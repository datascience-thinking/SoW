    "text": "Project information\nCapture and record key project metadata i.e., requestor, development unit, date, etc. The underlying principle for recording key project metadata is to capture sufficient information to provide an overview of the request, as well as seed further scoping, design, and planning if the project initiates, as well as provide an initial capture of what information is currently known.\nThe aim is to record the project overview, providing necessary context for understanding, and to support retrieval of project information later (by yourself or others).\nThe captured information can be used in subsequent documents and activities such as the set-up of project repositories (i.e., readme files), as well as form the seed of future analysis plans and project reports.\n\nProject title\nProvide a descriptive title for the project. Where possible add keywords to the title that would help support the understanding and retrieval of the project at a future date, especially by others who may not be familiar with the project but may benefit from the project outcomes (including data, code, methods, results, etc.).\nFor example, take the following title:\n\nClinical trial summaries. By adding additional descriptive information to the title\nProject xyz: summarizing clinical trial baseline demographics for the ABC program using SOTA techniques\n\nprovides additional clarifying information, such as a project code (xyz), the associated program (ABC), specific information to be explored (baseline demographics), and the methodology applied (SOTA [state of the art] techniques). The principle here, is not that all aspects should be covered, but that sufficient detail is provided for future project discovery, retrieval, and re-use.\n\n\nProject code / identifier (if applicable)\nAdd the project code or identifier if one exists. Ideally this would be a unique resource identifier that would be entered into a tracker and/or knowledge/ document management system. For example, a work or time & material related code, clinical study code, clinical program code, etc. The principle is to help support discovery and retrieval of the project and project outcomes later. ### Project requestor / sponsor (if applicable)\nAdd details of the requestor e.g. business unit. Who the project sponsor or stakeholder(s) are. Note, the requestor could be yourself. However, going through this exercise may be a useful exercise to clarify thinking prior to initiating a project of any scope.\n\n\nGxP applicability?\nIndicate if this work is purely exploratory (and for organization’s internal purposes) or if project outcomes may be subject to Health Authority (HA) interactions, part of a submission to a scientific publication, etc. The purpose is to help discussion and planning around potential verification and validation, especially to avoid rework later.\nFor purely exploratory work, provide appropriate indication of the level of verification & validation that will be undertaken when publishing and sharing outcomes (Kuemmel et al. 2020). If output is not formally reviewed or checked, consider using labels such as draft / exploratory, etc. to indicate this.\n\n\nProject keywords\nProvide keywords that may help with the retrieval or discovery of the project at a later point.\nTo aid keyword selection it may be helpful to answer the following questions:\n\nIn which circumstance would I or others want to find this project?\nWhat phrases may be used to search or find this project (i.e. not a general single term).\n\nWhen and how will the outputs of this project be used?\n\n\n\nVersion and revision history (change log)\nIt is important to provide an audit trial of the revision history of the SOW, either manually using the change log, or through commenting as part of a version control system (i.e. git). This provides a record of any changes in project direction or scope. However, the change log provides an immediate, accessible, history of important and key project changes an update to all readers of the SOW.\nA change log is provided in the SOW to handle changes or updates to the SOW."

Provide a rationale in terms of what is already known and what gaps exist (i.e. why this project is required). It is helpful to write down what is known at the start of the project. These details not only serve to identify the project goals but also serve to identify resources, both human and material, that may be used or required during the project.\nWriting down the background and context also helps identify potential gaps in understanding.\nThe aim of this section is to describe but also ensure there is a common understanding of the problem the project is trying to solve and why you/your organization are doing it i.e. to capture the purpose, scientific context, business value and justification. Use this exercise to understand what is known about the problem and why we are doing it, and what has been done before, but also to identify gaps in information, assumptions, etc.\n\nAre there related ongoing or completed projects?\nAre there specific areas of expertise that will be required?\netc.\n\nThe purpose reflects the overarching objective and should give an understanding of the need and potential value of the project. The purpose acts as the focal point of the investigation and provides clarity as to what that project is about, and why it is required, and what value it will bring to the organization. Thinking about what the project needs will also help make sure the project is relevant and will not be wasted time / resources i.e. has this work been done before?"

    "text": "Project objectives\nDescribe the primary objective, from a business or scientific perspective. In addition to the primary objective (i.e. key scientific question of interest), there are typically other related questions that may be of interest; the primary objective or question is potentially just one of several to support the purpose. Capture what is known. The questions may not be yet amenable or specific for analysis, however, writing down the questions as is can help reveal activities that are still required such as designing and refining the research question.\nWriting down the objective is the first step of the process as it is the most critical. Most projects start with a vague, abstract, or ill-posed problem (say, for example, “Crack Multiple Sclerosis (MS)”). Scoping can improve the definition, to become more concrete (e.g. identify the various phenotypes of MS) and keep refining until the goal is both concrete and measurable (i.e. identify the characteristics of primary progressive MS patient groups we can measure at trial enrollment who may respond to new drug X). This step is difficult because investigations may not have an explicitly defined analytical goal from the outset. Sometimes, these goals exist but are implicit and not clearly written down. Other times, there are several objectives that different members of the organization are trying to solve."

    "text": "Project outcome(s)\n\nWhat actions/decisions will the investigation inform?\nWhat are the expected outputs from the investigation?\n\nDescribe the criteria for a successful or useful outcome to the project from the business/scientific point of view. At this phase, this information might be quite specific and able to be measured objectively or it might be general and subjective. In the latter case, it should be indicated.\nIt is important to consider the impact of the project and if the project outcome is actionable i.e. what actions can be taken to achieve the specified goals? These actions should be concrete e.g. selecting a subgroup of patients based on a specified criterion, providing a list of potential prognostic variables, etc.\nAlso capture what are the expected deliverables i.e. a general or technical report, a published scientific manuscript, a conference abstract, a presentation to a decision board, etc. Also list other potential project artifact(s) that may be side effects of the project such as derived data, new methodology, analytical code, etc.\nDeliverables: Final Presentation, Technical Report, Gitlab/GitHub Code Repository, … Another principle here is to identify and factor in (potentially unstated) activities that may need to be planned to share outcomes internally and externally i.e. what approvals and reviews are required for publishing, what are the constraints to consider for publishing, what verification and validation activities may be required, etc.\nWhat about a small exploratory analysis for internal discussion?\nIn the context of developing an analysis strategy, the scope and detail required are largely influenced by the intended application of the results. In some instances, a simple e-mail outlining the request for analysis may serve adequately as the plan, while the outcomes can be communicated through various means such as figures, tables, or descriptive summaries. Emphasizing efficiency in the process is considered reasonable. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that once a document is distributed, the author relinquishes control over its subsequent circulation and impact. The potential for these materials to influence decision-making processes underscores the necessity of ensuring their credibility and traceability. This approach not only safeguards the author’s reputation and contributes value to the organization but also addresses the implications for patients who might be affected by these decisions."

For each data source, it’s good practice to find out how and where it is stored (source and derived). It may also be helpful to clarify data questions such as:\n\nWhat access requirement(s) or policies(s) would need to be considered (i.e. if the investigation involves secondary use of data), informed consent, anonymization, etc.\nWhat is the analysis readiness of the data (i.e. what data processing is required)?\nWhere will intermediate and analysis data be stored and shared (i.e. following FAIR principles? (Wilkinson et al. 2016).\n\nIf the data source(s) are not known, then capture this as an activity to be performed.\n\n\nOther resources\nIf known, write down the platforms and tools that may be used for each key task i.e. analytical, communication, code versioning, document, and knowledge management, etc. For example:\n\nWhat platform(s) will be used (e.g. clinical data platform, statistical computing environment, collaborative tools, …)?\nWhere is the source code to be stored and versioned (e.g. version control system, git, GitLab, GitHub, …)?\nList any known links to directories or code repositories already set up.\nWhere are documentation and other materials to be stored (Document Management Systems, Collaborative Tools Platform, …)?\n\nFor documentation it is important to agree upfront with the team if e.g. MS Office based solution (i.e. word and power point) or alternative plain text-based variations (amenable to git) will be used, and what will the workflow for contributing will be (i.e. review cycles), to avoid rework and additional effort later (Wilson et al. 2017).\nAn underlying principle here is to identify the source of truth for the project and where all materials are stored or to be shared i.e. inputs and outputs to analysis and modelling scripts.\n\n\nMethods\nList out the high-level activities required to achieve the objectives. For example:\n\nReview of potential analytical strategies\nInitial data analysis for understanding\nExploratory data analysis\nData derivations and transformations\nModel development (building, selection, checking, etc.)\nValidation and verification planning\nFake data simulation(s)\n\nThe principle here is not to select the first solution but explore a range of options and strategies that can help inform rationale and methodology approach. The project may go through phases of exploring options, refinement, then production and delivery once a clear rationale has been developed (Stoudt, Vásquez, and Martinez 2021)."

This task involves more detailed fact-finding about all the resources, constraints, assumptions, and other factors that should be considered in determining the analytical goal(s) and project plan. In the previous section, your objective is to quickly get to the crux of the situation. Here, you want to expand upon the details such as a high-level outline of the potential activities, resources, timelines, etc.\nIn this section there will be a need for a pragmatic assessment based on the initial scope of the project. If this is a small, self-contained request or need, then keep this section brief. If the request is potentially a large, multi-staged project, capture as much information as possible. Below is a guide of the things and themes to think about. Use this as a guide, not all sections will be relevant.\nCapture important information that is known including the following items:\n\nInventory of resources\nList the resources available to the project, including:\n\npersonnel (domain experts, data experts, data scientists, technical support, etc.),\ndata (fixed extracts, source data, anon data, synthetic data, analysis ready data, etc.),\ndata readiness assessment (i.e. source only, analysis ready data available, etc.),\ncomputing resources (hardware platforms e.g. data platform, IDE, …),\nsoftware (tools, packages, libraries, other relevant software).\ndocument and knowledge management - where is the single source of truth?\nProject access; who should have access to what, when?\n\n\n\nRequirements, assumptions, and constraints\nList all requirements of the project.\nIncluding schedule of completion, comprehensibility and quality of results, and security, as well as legal issues. As part of this output, make sure that you have permission to access and use the data.\n\n\nList the assumptions made by the project.\nThese may be assumptions about the data that can be verified during analysis but may also include non-verifiable assumptions about the business related to the project. It is particularly important to list the latter if it will affect the validity of the results.\n\n\nList the constraints on the project.\nThese may be constraints on the availability of resources but may also include technological constraints such as the size of dataset that it is practical to use for modeling.\n\n\nRisks and contingencies\nList the risks or events that might delay the project or cause it to fail i.e. risks (ethical, legal, safety, timelines, resources, etc.)\nRisks around data access, informed consent, anonymization, ethical, legal, safety, timelines, resources, etc.\nList the corresponding contingency plans, what action will be taken if these risks or events take place.\n\n\nSuccess and evaluation\nList what may be the evaluation level and type i.e. project is purely proof of concept, verification of results required (to what standard), analytical validation (or tools and methods), clinical validation, and/or utility or usability assessment (i.e. how would model be used in practice for decision making), etc.\n\n\nMore detailed project objectives\nList out more detailed project objectives if already specified or known., i.e. key information such as concept of interest, outcomes/endpoints of interest, other measurements of interest, patient populations, studies / sample sizes, information available, etc., reference standards (i.e. comparisons)"
